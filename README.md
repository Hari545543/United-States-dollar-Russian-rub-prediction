# Models Used
Linear Regression: This model is most useful in data which is linearly correlated. It simply finds the "Best fit coefficients" by using the standard linear regression formula.

**Support Vector Machine:** 
This model is also very useful when the data is linearly correlated. Although, SVMs are capable of projecting the data into greater dimensions to find out better patterns.

**Decision Tree Classifier:**
This model identifies the most informative attribute at every level and uses it to make a tree. The final tree can then be used as a simple if-else statement to identify the final prediction.
